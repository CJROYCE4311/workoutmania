# Client Management

This directory is for managing all client information.

## Onboarding a New Client

1.  **Copy the Template**: Duplicate the `/Client_A_Template/` folder.
2.  **Rename**: Rename the copied folder to the new client's name (e.g., `/John_Doe/`).
3.  **Fill out Information**: Populate the sub-folders with the client's specific information:
    *   **/Assessments**: Store initial assessments, movement screens, benchmark workout results, and progress photos.
    *   **/Programming**: Store the client's specific workout programs and cycles.
    *   **/Communications**: Keep a log of check-ins, video calls, and other important communications.
