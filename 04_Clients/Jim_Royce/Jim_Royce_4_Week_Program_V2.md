# Peak Performance Programming V2 (Masters Conjugate)
## 4-Week Training Cycle for Jim Royce

> **Methodology Update:** This cycle shifts to a **Conjugate Model** (Max Effort / Dynamic Effort) to manage CNS fatigue while maintaining high-intensity outputs. It incorporates **Hinshaw Pacing** for aerobic work and **Odd Object Training** to reduce spinal loading frequency.
