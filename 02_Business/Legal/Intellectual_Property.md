# Intellectual Property & Legal Strategy
**Date:** 2026-01-20
**Disclaimer:** This is not legal advice. Consult an attorney for final review.

## 1. The "CrossFit" Trademark
**The Rule:** CrossFit LLC is extremely litigious. You cannot use the word "CrossFit" to describe your service, product, or business unless you are a licensed affiliate ($3,000/year).

*   **Do Not Use:**
    *   "CrossFit Coaching"
    *   "CrossFit Programming"
    *   "Jim's CrossFit"
    *   "CrossFitting" (Verb)
*   **Safe Alternatives:**
    *   "Functional Fitness"
    *   "High-Intensity Functional Training (HIFT)"
    *   "Strength & Conditioning"
    *   "Metcon"
    *   "GPP (General Physical Preparedness)"

**Bio Exception:** Teaganne *can* say "CrossFit Level 2 Trainer" in her bio (e.g., "About the Coach"), as that is a factual credential she holds. But the *business* cannot be "Teaganne's CrossFit Program."

## 2. Patenting Exercises
**The Rule:** You cannot patent a human body movement (e.g., a "Burpee").
*   **Exercises:** You are safe to program Snatch, Clean & Jerk, Thrusters, etc. These are public domain.
*   **WOD Names:** Famous WOD names ("Fran", "Murph") are arguably trademarks of CrossFit, though often used loosely. **Recommendation:** Rename them. Call "Fran" -> "Thruster Sprint". Call "Murph" -> "The Body Armor Challenge".
*   **Your IP:** Your *specific sequence* of workouts (the 4-Week Cycle) is your copyright.

## 3. Remote Insurance
**The Risk:** A standard "Personal Trainer" policy often covers *in-person* only. If a client gets hurt in their garage in London while you are in New York, a standard policy might deny the claim.
**Requirement:** You need **"Online/Remote Coaching Liability"** insurance.
*   **Key Clause:** "Worldwide Coverage" (since internet is worldwide).
*   **Providers to Check:**
    *   *Insure Fitness Group*
    *   *Next Insurance*
    *   *Alternative Balance* (Explicit worldwide/online coverage).

## 4. Branding Strategy
**Current Name:** "CrossFit Virtual Coaching" (In GEMINI.md).
**Action:** **CHANGE THIS IMMEDIATELY.**
*   *Proposal:* "Royce Performance", "Functional Engine", "Vanguard Training".
*   *Why?* Using "CrossFit" in the business name is a guaranteed Cease & Desist letter.
