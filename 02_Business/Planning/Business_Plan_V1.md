# Project: Virtual CrossFit Coaching Side Hustle

## Goal
The primary goal is to establish a virtual coaching and/or programming business for CrossFit. This business aims to leverage the combined skills and resources of the team to provide remote fitness services.

## The Team

*   **You:** Providing time, resources, and technical expertise (potentially using AI).
*   **Jim (Brother):** A successful CrossFit athlete whose experience can be used for marketing and credibility. He is currently paying for coaching and is interested in exploring AI-based programming as an alternative.
*   **Teaganne (Jim's girlfriend):** A CrossFit Level 2 (CF-L2) coach with credentials and experience coaching at reputable gyms (CrossFit Union Square). Her professional background adds legitimacy and expertise to the venture.

## The Idea
The core concept originated from a conversation about using AI to create CrossFit programming for Jim, potentially replacing his human coach. This evolved into a larger business idea:

1.  **Leverage Jim's Success:** Use his athletic achievements as a case study or marketing asset.
2.  **Leverage Teaganne's Credentials:** Her CF-L2 certification and coaching experience provide the necessary qualifications and trust.
3.  **Leverage Your Resources:** Utilize your time and technical skills to manage the business and explore innovative solutions like AI for programming.
4.  **Provide Virtual Services:** Offer coaching and programming to clients remotely.
