Did E2MOM 50M for 10 rounds, then E4MOM 100M for 5 rounds. Worked on breathing technique and attempting to stay calm in the water. Roughly 1:35-1:40 / 100M during the 50s, between 1:40 and 1:45 / 100M during the 100s. Ideally, we'd devote every Thursday to swimming between now and Legends, working up to some 200 (or maybe 250) M intervals by then. Cautiously optimistic after today.",21:14,6:58.

"Finally got to the gym this late AM. Up and down day with the snatch, as you'll see. Couple things I'd like to say here. One, I realized on the 187 barbell I wasn't punching out on the turnover like I know I can, so I made a more determined effort to do that the rest of the way. The second thing is my right knee. I clipped a manual slow motion video of it from the high pull to the catch; it drops 2-3"" relative to my left knee (which, I think, is fairly well-positioned). Do you have any sense how to isolate this habit (due to mobility limitations or, perhaps, just endless repetitions and muscle memory) so we can work to correct it? It has to be playing a significant role in catching the bar forward, losing stability, etc., at those higher weights. 

Anyway, the ARs were really poorly calibrated here; I was probably losing 2 kph due to it. So, to keep to the time domain and the desired stimulus, I did 1200M each round. Was probably a little under what I should have done (looks like 1,350 was the right calculation) but, in the moment, I was grasping at straws; it was so dispiriting to see me push and the speedometer to read < 12 kph 😔. Did the DLs UB and finished in 6:45 - 6:38 - 6:36 / did 2 x 100M swim in their pool outside after all this (1 combined sesh). I don't know where you got 200 from; 100 is my functional max for right now. I'll have access to a pool when I'm in the city and, with minimal exception (like next Wed-Fri), that's where I'll be when I get back from Dubai.","2s on the :30 for sHSPU; extra one as time expired (21) / Front Squat 242-257-275-290 / 76 reps (metcon).
Man, thot moderate-heavy weight hang clean for reps was an unfamiliar movement to start the metcon. Didn't want to break more than I had to, since it was from the hang but, in retrospect, i should've done 5s from the beginning, and tried to quicken the breaks somewhat. I got more of a rhythm to the movement as time went on, but I spiked pretty early and had to fight from there. Decent takeaway is the thrusters felt better than expected, under the circumstances.","143x3, 154x2 on the SG Push Press / 154-165-176-187-198 Snatch pulls / 20:50 metcon. Did 55-25 burpees w/ ~:20 break (finished @ 4:36). Took me a bit to get pulling on the row (right at 5:00 mark), and was 2:02 or so for the first 350M. Settled in between 1000 and 1050 cal/hr and held the rest of the way. Last 250M sprint topped out at 1200 cal/hr.",,"50' EMOM x 2, then 4 x 25' EMOM (5:20) / 205 bench",,8:28:00 AM (245),

Slipped a bit on rep 2, but recovered OK. Obviously would love to have finished, but I am pretty happy with the effort on the first part). 

By the way, as I'm analyzing my video (and remembering what it felt like), the last round of BMU I think, regardless of my fatigue, should have been able to complete them unbroken. However, I think I need some practice doing a set of 5 or 6 when I'm really metabolically tired. Hopefully, we can practice that once this coming week, by throwing them in after some metabolic spikes (like 20-cal bike sprints or something, on repeat). It wasn't pulling power I lost, it was the fact I wasn't making sure I was directly under the bar before trying to turn over. Instead, I was out in front of it still. 

Doubtless, we'll see high-volume BMU under metabolic strain, so I'd like to get a win under my belt before we see it next week. What do you think?",

2:15-2:12-2:12-2:14-2:13-2:12 (1:52.5/500M Pace thru, ~ 30-ft. HSW) / 175-185-195-205","Here might be a better place for me to express my thoughts on the competition. I have several things to report: 

1. I was surprised at the level of nerves I experienced on the first workout (lifting complex), given the low-ish stakes of the event. I missed my first S2O, then had to triage the rest of the 6-minute lifting window to do damage control. Also, looking at the videos of all the lifts, my back leg revertied to old form, straight as an arrow. So we'll have to continue to drill the jerk position we began lasat week a lot more before it is second nature on heavy lifts under duress. 

2. The last workout yielded some good things, as it was the only place I was really challenged with potential failure. The workout was a progression through oly lifts and rig movements, 20 reps apiece, starting lighter and progressing to heavier weights. I had my partner do most of the work for the buy-in rounds, since I knew I would bear the burden of the heavier snatches later on. By about the 5-minute mark, we had completed the first 4 movements, and progressed to 20 snatches @ 185. I did a set of 4, relatively quick singles (all power snatches that I hit with decent confidence), and then gave him a crack to do what he could. He failed, so I went back and did another 4. This continued throughout so that, by the end, I did all 20, in sets of 4, and while my cadence slowed some as we progressed, I didn't fail any reps, and we had enough time left over in the 12-minute cap to get the 20 BMU in (I did 14 of those as he was relegated to 2s--this workout was a little advanced for him). So, in any case, it was a good opportunity to grind through a high volume of heavy power snatches, and still be able to pivot to some high-skill gymnastics without too much dealy or difficulty.

Overall, then, I had a lot of fun, got some good work in, and got to refresh some of the feelings associated with live competition that I know will return in Birmingham.",,

"49:46. Did this at a local affiliate. Did 5 rounds of 20-40-60. Feel pretty sore today (Tuesday), but good experience.","Finished at ~400W echo bike, 1050 cal/hr ski, 1:48/500M row / 245 / 👍 / 1:50-1:46 on the metcon—missed the touch on a couple GHDs in later rounds so cost me a few seconds. Otherwise UB and consistent.","PJs @ 150 / SJs @ 200 / traveled to MA, so didn't have time for the C2B or dips. Got right into metcon--probably went harder than 85% throughout. Would not have been able to go back to back (to back) at that pace w/o the 2:00 rest. So perhaps missed the stimulus intended somewhat. Did 1:06-1:12 throughout, got faster as it went along.",,"Konked out last night. Was feeling a little tight in my chest this morning on the run (some travel, intense allergies, so my asthma's acting up a touch, but otherwise OK). 3:07-3:06-3:12 on the runs / 5:13 metcon","135-155-170186-200-215 (F-F-👍) / 13:05 (no easy reps there—thought I'd videoed it, but never hit the button I guess). 20-15-10-5 WB — 20-12-8 C2B — 10-8-6-4-2 DL — 5-5-5-3-2 — quick finish. DLs were surprisingly the most taxing part. Thought I could do 5s all the way at HSPU, but failed rep 19. Good workout though.",,

"Good workout this morning. Prepared and executed (mostly) well. 19:32 RX. Looked at last year's SF scores; would have been in the bottom 3rd (sheesh), on a workout that should be good for me. Went 1:50 1st 1K, 1:53, 1:55, 1:52 the next 3 rounds. 75-25, 50-25, 50, 25 on the DUs w/ a couple trips in later rounds, and good cadence on the runs. Hard to see squeezing out another :45 - 1:00 on that, but I suppose it's possible. Would have put me in even worse shape to try to snatch heavy at that point, but that's the point of semis, I suppose. No holes allowed. PM: Power snatch 175-190-200-200 (I'd like to get your thoughts on the heavy power snatch—I'm not proud of the result necessarily, but I am trying to conceive of the power snatch as more than just grip n rip like I historically have done. Not there yet, but I think there's something there. Will keep working on it. Metcon: 199. Happy w the C2B on this one. Decent capacity. After a very long day.",6-6-4-5-4-5-8-8.5 (almost got it on time) /106 (wayyy more grippy than I was expecting),"Front Squat 305 (belted starting at 255) / Metcon: 16:27 (had no idea what this workout was going to feel like, so set a 25:00 timecap. In retrospect, I could've pushed the lunges a bit more; otherwise, I'm very happy with my performance and pacing.",,AM 2+11-2+8-2-2-1+12 (166 reps) Was very dismayed when I saw last year's scores in my division—then notice they did it at 155!! 🫣 / :03 (long way to go again here) / PM 4:06 / 3:45,8 (5-3) - 8 (5-3) - 9 (5-3-1) - 9 (6-3) / 185 - 4:21 (165),,
