- **Start Date:** 2026-01-20
- **Primary Goal:** Improve Engine Capacity & Gymnastics Efficiency
- **Secondary Goal:** Maintain existing strength base.

---

### **Cycle Overview**

This 4-week cycle is designed to address Jim's "Strength-Biased" archetype by focusing on his weaknesses. The volume and intensity are managed according to his `MASTERS_B` recovery profile, with a hard cap of two heavy spinal loading sessions per week.

---

### **Week 1: Foundational & Volume Accumulation**
*   **Focus:** Build a strong aerobic base with longer, sustainable "Zone 2" efforts. Re-enforce perfect mechanics in gymnastics with strict movements and positional holds.
*   **Strength:** Work with higher volume at moderate percentages (75-80%) to maintain neurological patterns without excessive CNS fatigue.
*   **Spinal Loading:** One heavy day (Squats).

### **Week 2: Intensity & Skill Integration**
*   **Focus:** Introduce lactate threshold work through classic CrossFit intervals (e.g., 400m-800m repeats). Begin combining foundational gymnastics skills into simple couplets and triplets to build capacity under fatigue.
*   **Strength:** One heavy day, focusing on positional strength (e.g., pause squats) to improve control.
*   **Spinal Loading:** One heavy day (Squats).

### **Week 3: Peak Week & Pacing Practice**
*   **Focus:** Simulate competition intensity with longer, more complex metcons that demand pacing strategy and efficient transitions. Gymnastics skills are tested under higher fatigue.
*   **Strength:** One heavy day, shifted to an upper-body press to respect the cumulative spinal load of the cycle.
*   **Spinal loading:** One heavy day (Deadlifts).

### **Week 4: Deload & Skill Refinement**
*   **Focus:** Actively recover. Volume and intensity are reduced by ~50%. Sessions are shorter and focused on flawless movement quality and light skill practice.
*   **Strength:** No heavy lifting. Focus on mobility and light-load technique work.
*   **Spinal Loading:** None.
