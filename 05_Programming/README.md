# Programming Hub

This directory is the central location for creating and organizing all workout programming.

## Workflow

1.  **Cycles**: Plan long-term training blocks (e.g., "8-Week Strength Cycle," "2025 Open Prep") in this folder. Each cycle should have its own document outlining the goals and structure.
2.  **Templates**: Create reusable workout templates here. For example, you might have a template for a 3-day-a-week program or a template for a specific type of interval workout.
3.  **Daily_WODs**: Store individual workouts here, which can then be assembled into programs for specific clients.
