# Supplements: The Essential Stack

## Executive Summary
For CrossFit, only two supplements have "Grade A" evidence for performance enhancement: **Creatine Monohydrate** (Power/Strength) and **Beta-Alanine** (Muscle Endurance). Almost everything else is marketing fluff.

## Key Methodology
1.  **Creatine Monohydrate:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Increases Phosphocreatine stores (PCr). This allows for faster ATP regeneration during 0-10s max efforts.
    *   **Benefit:** Get that 5th rep when you usually fail at 4.
    *   **Protocol:** 5g daily. Forever. No loading phase needed. Take post-workout.
2.  **Beta-Alanine:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Buffers acidity (Hydrogen ions) in the muscle.
    *   **Benefit:** Delays the "burning" sensation. Allows you to push harder in the 60s-240s time domain (Fran, Grace, 400m Run).
    *   **Side Effect:** Paresthesia (tingling face). Harmless.
    *   **Protocol:** 3-5g daily. Consistent intake matters more than timing.

## Application to Our Programming
- **Jim's Stack:**
    *   **Morning:** Beta-Alanine (3g).
    *   **Post-Workout:** Creatine (5g) + Whey Protein + Carbs.
    *   *Note:* If Jim complains of "tingling," split the Beta-Alanine dose (1.5g AM, 1.5g PM).
