## Executive Summary
There is no supplement, drug, or training program that compensates for poor sleep. For athletes, sleep is where physical repair (HGH release) and mental repair (Motor learning consolidation) happen. < 7 hours = Injury risk doubles.

## Key Methodology
1.  **The "10-3-2-1-0" Rule:**
    *   **10 hours before bed:** No more caffeine.
    *   **3 hours before bed:** No more food / alcohol. (Digestion disrupts deep sleep).
    *   **2 hours before bed:** No more work. (Cortisol reduction).
    *   **1 hour before bed:** No more screens (Blue light blocks Melatonin).
    *   **0:** The number of times you hit snooze.
2.  **Environment:**
    *   **Temperature:** 65-68°F (18-20°C). The body needs to cool down to enter REM.
    *   **Darkness:** Pitch black. Use blackout curtains or an eye mask.
3.  **HGH Release:**
    *   The majority of Human Growth Hormone is released during the first phase of Deep Sleep (SWS). If you go to bed late or drink alcohol, you miss this window.

## Application to Our Programming
- **Jim's Protocol:**
    *   **Training Time:** Avoid heavy metcons within 3 hours of bed (CNS arousal makes sleep hard).
    *   **Magnesium:** Supplementing Magnesium Bisglycinate (400mg) 30 mins before bed can aid relaxation.
    *   **The "Sleep Audit":** If Jim stalls on strength numbers, ask about his sleep before changing the rep scheme.
