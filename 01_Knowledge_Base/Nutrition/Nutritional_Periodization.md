## Executive Summary
Nutritional Periodization (Carb Cycling) matches fuel intake to activity levels. High-intensity CrossFit training demands glucose (carbs), while rest days do not. By cycling intake, athletes maximize performance on hard days and fat oxidation on rest days.

## Key Methodology
1.  **High Carb Days (Training Days):**
    *   **Goal:** Replenish Glycogen & Fuel Glycolytic Work.
    *   **Intake:** High (2.5g+ per lb of bodyweight).
    *   **Timing:** Pre-workout (for energy) and Post-workout (for insulin spike/recovery).
    *   **When:** Double sessions, "Murph", Leg Days.
2.  **Low Carb Days (Rest/Active Recovery):**
    *   **Goal:** Increase Insulin Sensitivity & Burn Fat.
    *   **Intake:** Low (<1g per lb or <100g total).
    *   **Focus:** High Protein, Moderate/High Fat, Veggies.
    *   **When:** Zone 2 days, Rest days, Skill days.
3.  **Protein Constant:**
    *   Protein never changes. It stays high (1g/lb) every day to prevent muscle catabolism.

## Application to Our Programming
- **The "Jim" Protocol:**
    *   **Monday (Heavy Squat + Metcon):** High Carb. Eat the rice/potatoes.
    *   **Wednesday (Zone 2 / Swim):** Moderate/Low Carb. Fuel the swim, but no need for a massive surplus.
    *   **Thursday (Rest):** Low Carb. Focus on steak, eggs, avocado.
    *   **Intra-Workout:** For sessions > 60 mins (e.g., Saturday), introduce liquid carbs (Gatorade/Dextrose).
