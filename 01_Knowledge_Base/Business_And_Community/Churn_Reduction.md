# Churn Reduction: Keeping the Tribe

## Executive Summary
Clients don't leave because the workout was too hard. They leave because they felt **ignored** or **stagnant**. Retention is about "Perceived Progress" and "Relationship."

## Key Methodology
1.  **The "Bright Spot" Friday:**
    *   **Action:** Every Friday, send a personal text/video to 5 clients.
    *   **Content:** "Hey, I saw that Snatch PR. That form improvement was huge. Good work."
    *   **Why:** It proves you are watching.
2.  **The "Future Pace":**
    *   **Concept:** Always talk about the *next* goal before the current one is finished.
    *   **Tactic:** In Week 3 of a cycle, say: "We are doing this volume now so that in *April*, we can hit that 5k PR."
    *   **Result:** They can't quit in March because they have a goal in April.
3.  **The "Exit Interview":**
    *   If they quit, get them on the phone. Ask "Why?"
    *   *Real Reason:* Usually "I didn't use it enough" (Value mismatch) or "I got hurt" (Programming failure).

## Application to Our Operations
- **The "Jim" Rule:**
    *   Jim is family, he won't quit.
    *   *But for real clients:* If a client misses 3 workouts in a row, the "Red Flag" system triggers.
    *   **Action:** Teaganne calls them immediately. Not an email. A call. "Everything okay?"
