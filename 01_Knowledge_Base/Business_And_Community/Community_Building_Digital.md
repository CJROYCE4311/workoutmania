# Community Building: The Digital Box

## Executive Summary
In a physical gym, community happens by accident (shared suffering). In a digital gym, it must be **engineered**. If clients feel isolated, they quit. If they feel part of a "Team," they stay forever.

## Key Methodology
1.  **The "Third Space" (The Platform):**
    *   **Tool:** SugarWOD / Slack / Discord.
    *   **Requirement:** There must be a place to post scores and "fist bump."
    *   **Rule:** The Coach must comment on EVERY post for the first 50 clients.
2.  **The "Team Challenge" (Quarterly):**
    *   **Concept:** "The 100 Mile Month" or "The Burpee Bank."
    *   **Why:** It gives clients a shared enemy/goal, even if they live in different time zones.
3.  **The "Athlete Spotlight":**
    *   **Action:** Monthly email/post highlighting a client (not the elite one, the relatable one who just got their first pull-up).
    *   **Benefit:** Makes the "hero" feel special and shows others that progress is possible.

## Application to Our Operations
- **Jim is the "Captain":**
    *   Jim posts his scores daily.
    *   We create a "Team Jim" leaderboard.
    *   **Tactic:** Every Friday, Jim posts a video: "Here's how I attacked this week." Clients comment below.
