## Executive Summary
The most dangerous time for client churn is the first 30 days. If the onboarding process is clunky, they assume the coaching is clunky. A smooth, professional intake builds trust and compliance.

## Key Methodology (The Checklist)
1.  **Day 0 (The Sign-Up):**
    *   **Automated Email:** "Welcome to the Team." Includes link to Waiver, Intake Form, and App Download (TrueCoach/SugarWOD).
    *   **Intake Form:** Must capture: Injury History, Equipment List (Do they have a rower? A pull-up bar?), and "The Why" (Goals).
2.  **Day 1 (The Setup):**
    *   **Video Call (15-30 mins):** "The Strategy Session."
    *   *Agenda:* Review injury history, set schedule (3x vs 5x per week), explain the app.
    *   *Deliverable:* Client gets their "Week 1" plan uploaded.
3.  **Week 1 (High Touch):**
    *   **Check-in:** Text/DM after the *first* workout. "How did the squat feel?"
    *   **Video Review:** Ask for 1 video of their lift to establish form standards.
4.  **Day 30 (The Review):**
    *   **Progress Check:** Did we hit the Week 1 goals?
    *   **Re-commit:** Set goals for Month 2.

## Application to Our Operations
