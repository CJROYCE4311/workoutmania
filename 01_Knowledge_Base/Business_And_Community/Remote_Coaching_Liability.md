**Source:** Legal Blogs (FitLegally) / TwoBrain Business
**Tags:** Legal, Business, Risk Management

## Executive Summary
Remote coaching carries *different* risks than gym coaching. You cannot see the client's environment (e.g., a cat walking under a barbell). Therefore, your waiver must explicitly state that **the client assumes all risks regarding their equipment and environment**.

## Key Requirements
1.  **The "Assumption of Risk" Clause:**
    *   Must be specific to "Online/Remote Training."
    *   *Language:* "I acknowledge that I am training in my own environment, unsupervised, and assume all risks associated with my equipment and space."
2.  **The "Scope of Practice" Disclaimer:**
    *   You are a Coach, not a Doctor or Physical Therapist.
    *   *Language:* "The programming provided is for educational and fitness purposes only. It is not medical advice/treatment."
3.  **The "Hold Harmless" Agreement:**
    *   Client agrees not to sue you if they get hurt doing a snatch in their garage.
