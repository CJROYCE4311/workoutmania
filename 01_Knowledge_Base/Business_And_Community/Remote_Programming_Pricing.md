# Pricing Models: Individual Design (ID) vs. Templates
**Source:** Trainerize / OPEX Fitness

## Executive Summary
There are two main ways to sell programming: **Volume (Templates)** and **Value (Individual Design)**. Mixing them up causes brand confusion.

## Key Methodology
1.  **Individual Design (ID):**
    *   **The Product:** A bespoke relationship. The coach watches videos, adjusts volume weekly based on feedback, and handles nutrition.
    *   **Price Point:** $200 - $350 / month.
    *   **Capacity:** 1 Coach can handle ~30-50 clients max.
    *   **Ideal Client:** Competitors, Injuries, High-touch needs.
2.  **The Template (Track):**
    *   **The Product:** Access to a generic program (e.g., "The Engine Track"). No video review. No customization.
    *   **Price Point:** $20 - $50 / month.
    *   **Capacity:** Unlimited.
    *   **Ideal Client:** Experienced athletes who just need a plan to follow.

## Application to Our Business
- **The "Jim" Prototype is ID:**
    *   We are building an ID business first.
    *   *Why?* It validates the method.
- **The Future Scale (Templates):**
    *   Once the "Jim Method" works, we package it as "The Masters Engine Track" and sell it for $40/mo.
- **Recommendation:**
    *   Launch with **ID Only** ($250/mo). Get 5 clients.
    *   Do not launch a $40 track yet. It devalues the brand until you have social proof.
