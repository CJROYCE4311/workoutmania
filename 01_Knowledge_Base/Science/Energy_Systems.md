# Energy Systems: The Physiology of Work

## Executive Summary
The body uses three primary pathways to produce ATP (energy). While all three are active at all times, the *dominant* system depends on the **intensity** and **duration** of the effort. Effective CrossFit programming must train all three systems to avoid "gaps" in fitness.

## Key Methodology
1.  **Phosphagen System (ATP-CP):**
    *   **Fuel:** Stored ATP & Creatine Phosphate.
    *   **Duration:** 0 - 10 seconds.
    *   **Intensity:** 95-100% (Max Effort).
    *   **Example:** 1RM Snatch, 100m Sprint.
    *   **Training:** Work:Rest ratio of 1:12 to 1:20 (e.g., 10s sprint, 2-3 min rest).
2.  **Glycolytic System (Anaerobic Lactic):**
    *   **Fuel:** Glycogen (Carbs) -> Lactate.
    *   **Duration:** 10 seconds - 2 minutes.
    *   **Intensity:** 75-95% (Hard, burning sensation).
    *   **Example:** "Fran", 400m Run, heavy set of 10 squats.
    *   **Training:** Work:Rest ratio of 1:3 to 1:5. Painful but necessary for "closing speed."
3.  **Oxidative System (Aerobic):**
    *   **Fuel:** Fat (at low intensity) & Glycogen (at higher intensity) + Oxygen.
    *   **Duration:** > 2 minutes (indefinite).
    *   **Intensity:** < 75% (Sustainable).
    *   **Example:** 5k Run, Murph, 2k Row.
    *   **Training:** Work:Rest ratio of 1:1 or continuous.

## Application to Our Programming
- **The "CrossFit Trap":** Most CrossFit WODs sit squarely in the **Glycolytic** bucket (8-15 mins, high heart rate).
- **The Fix for Jim:**
    *   **Polarized Training:** We need to do more work at the *edges* (ATP-CP and Oxidative) to build the middle.
    *   **Monday (Conjugate ME):** Trains ATP-CP (Heavy single).
    *   **Wednesday (Zone 2):** Trains Oxidative (Fat adaptation).
    *   **Metcons:** Should be varied. Don't make every workout a 12-minute glycolytic burn.
        *   *Sprint Day:* 5 rounds of 15s work / 3 min rest (ATP-CP).
        *   *Engine Day:* 30 min steady work (Oxidative).
