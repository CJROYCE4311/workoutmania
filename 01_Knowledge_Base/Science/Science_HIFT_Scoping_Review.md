Abstract
High-Intensity Functional Training (HIFT) is a training method that has garnered increasing
attention due to the rise in hybrid competitions such as CrossFit or Hyrox, a race format
combining strength and endurance tasks in a fixed structure. Therefore, an integrative
approach is needed to help us understand which physiological capacities this training
method enhances. Objectives: This scoping review aimed to map the current scientific
literature related to HIFT, with a particular focus on physiological and psychobiological
determinants of performance in hybrid competition contexts. Methods: Following the
methodological framework of Arksey and O’Malley and the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a
systematic search was conducted in Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. Thirty-nine
studies published between 2015 and 2025 were included. Results: HIFT was found to
improve key physical attributes such as aerobic capacity, muscular strength, anaerobic
power, and fatigue tolerance. Increases in VO2max ranging from 8% to 15% and strength
gains of 10% to 20% in major lifts were commonly reported. Improvements in local muscular
endurance, power output, and recovery capacity were also observed. The physiological
benefits appeared more pronounced in trained individuals, especially those with greater
resistance training volume. In addition, psychobiological responses, including perceived
exertion, cognitive control, and motivation, were explored in several studies, with more
experienced athletes showing higher fatigue tolerance and better performance consistency
under stress. Conclusions: HIFT enhances essential physical attributes applicable to hybrid
events. The findings support the use of HIFT as a foundational method for training athletes
involved in demanding multi-domain fitness settings, without attributing these benefits
specifically to any single competitive event.

1. Introduction
Performance in hybrid sport disciplines, defined as competitive formats that combine
cyclical endurance elements (e.g., running, rowing) with functional strength tasks (e.g.,
weightlifting, carries, callisthenics) within a fixed or timed structure, depends on the
integration of strength and endurance capacities, which raises the challenge of concurrent
training, defined as the combination of strength and endurance exercises in the same
session or within a periodised programme [1,2]. Theoretical frameworks such as the

interference effect and the theory of adaptation pathways are essential to understanding
the physiological complexity of concurrent training, especially in hybrid formats. The
interference effect refers to the idea that combining strength and endurance training,
particularly when done in the same session or with insufficient recovery, can limit the full
development of one or both capacities. For example, intense endurance training may reduce
the gains typically expected from strength training. The theory of adaptation pathways
complements this by proposing that the body adapts differently depending on the type,
order, and intensity of the training stimulus. When multiple demands are placed on the
body at once, the way they are sequenced can influence which adaptations dominate. In
hybrid competitions, where strength and endurance are constantly mixed with little rest,
understanding these principles helps coaches and athletes structure training to improve
both capacities without compromising performance [3,4].
Within the framework of high-intensity training, HIFT (high-intensity functional
training) has gained popularity as a method that integrates functional movements with
high loads and minimal rests, with the aim of improving general and functional fitness [5].
This approach incorporates elements of weightlifting, cardiovascular conditioning and
gymnastic exercises, optimising physical domains such as strength, coordination, speed
and agility [6]. Due to the rise in these HIFT methods, hybrid competitions are becoming
increasingly popular in the world of competitive sports. One of the best-known sports in
this field is CrossFit. This sport incorporates routines named “WOD” (Work Of the Day),
which combine varied functional movements performed at high intensity [7].
Another hybrid competition that is growing in popularity is HYROX, which integrates
running with structured functional exercises. HYROX, for instance, is a well-known
competitive event that integrates running intervals with functional exercises in a fixed
sequence. What differentiates HYROX from CrossFit is its standardised format and the
specific combination of prolonged endurance (8 × 1 km runs) with repeated high-intensity
tasks performed with minimal recovery time between them (SkiErg, Sled Push/Pull, Burpee
Broad Jump, RowErg, Farmers Carry, Sandbag Lunges and Wall Balls). Recent studies have
begun to analyse the acute physiological responses and performance factors associated
with HYROX identifying its main physical demands and suggests the need for specific
preparation strategies [8].
Despite widespread use, few reviews systematically map physiological and psychobi-
ological determinants of performance in HIFT or hybrid formats. Given the increasing
popularity of HIFT-based competitions, understanding performance indicators is necessary
to optimise science-based programming and training.
Considering all of this, this scoping review aims to explore the literature on physio-
logical adaptations, performance predictors, and psychobiological responses associated
with HIFT. By focusing on both general HIFT practice and its implementation in structured
competitions, the review seeks to support practitioners in optimising training protocols.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design
The SALSA structure [9] was used for the development of this review. This frame-
work uses four critical phases (Search, AppraisaL, Synthesis and Analysis) to both guide
and evaluate a scoping review. This scoping review was conducted in accordance with
the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines [10]. The review protocol was not registered in
any public database.
We followed the 5 stages of the methodological framework for scoping reviews Arksey
and O’Malley [11] and the recommendations and additional proposals of Codina [12]: (1)
J. Funct. Morphol. Kinesiol. 2025, 10, 365 3 of 24
identification of the research question (s); (2) search for relevant studies; (3) selection of
studies; (4) data extraction and analysis; and (5) collection, synthesis and presentation
of results.
The choice of a scoping review is motivated by the need to map an emerging field
(HIFT or hybrid formats), where methodological diversity, heterogeneity of studies and
the lack of a consolidated empirical basis make the use of traditional systematic reviews or
meta-analyses unsuitable.
2.2. Eligibility Criteria
The following inclusion criteria were established:
1. 3. Studies published from 2015 onwards.
2. Languages: English or Spanish.
Participants aged 16 and over.
Thematic focus on High Intensity Functional Training (HIFT), CrossFit, concurrent
training or HYROX-type hybrid competitions.
Studies related to clinical populations (e.g., chronic disease, cancer, Parkinson’s),
pregnancy, injury prevention, nutrition or interventions not directly related to performance
or physical training were excluded.
2.3. Information Sources and Search Strategy
The literature search was conducted between December 2024 and May 2025 in three
databases: Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. Search terms were combined using
Boolean operators and adapted for each database. The complete search strategy included
the following string: (“concurrent training” OR “Crosstraining” OR “high intensity func-
tional training”) AND (“CrossFit” OR “HYROX” OR “hybrid competitions”). Filters were
applied to include only peer-reviewed journal articles published in English or Spanish
between 2015 and 2025. A total of 331 records were retrieved: 122 from Web of Science,
117 from Scopus, and 92 from PubMed. After removing 192 duplicates, 139 articles were
screened based on title and abstract. Studies were included if they (1) investigated high-
intensity functional training (HIFT) protocols or hybrid training modalities (e.g., CrossFit,
HYROX), (2) reported physiological or psychobiological outcomes, and (3) involved healthy
adult populations. Exclusion criteria were: (a) studies not published in English or Spanish,
(b) lack of access to full text, (c) non-peer-reviewed sources, and (d) studies that did not
address physiological or performance-related variables. Following screening and full-text
assessment, 39 studies met the inclusion criteria and were analysed in the review.
2.4. Selecting Sources of Evidence
The results of the searches were exported to EndNoteTM20 for automatic removal of
duplicates. Titles and abstracts were then independently assessed by two reviewers. Those
studies that met the criteria were read in full text to confirm inclusion. Discrepancies were
resolved by consensus or, if necessary, by consulting a third reviewer.
2.5. Data Mining
The data were organised and recorded in an Excel spreadsheet. For each study
included, the following variables were extracted: author/year, study design, sample
characteristics, objectives, methodology, main findings and conclusions.
2.6. Quality Assessment
The quality of the included studies was assessed using the AXIS (Appraisal Tool for
Cross-Sectional Studies) tool, developed specifically to evaluate cross-sectional studies.
J. Funct. Morphol. Kinesiol. 2025, 10, 365 4 of 24
This tool allows common methodological weaknesses to be identified through 20 items
covering key aspects such as: clarity of objectives, appropriateness of design, justification
of sample size, sample selection process, validity of measures used, and transparency in
the presentation of results [13].
For interpretive purposes, the studies were classified into three levels according to
the percentage of items met: high quality (≥75%), moderate quality (50–74%), and low
quality (<50%). This categorization was not used as an exclusion criterion, but it did allow
for contextualising the findings and qualifying the degree of confidence in the results.

Brandt, Ebel [8]
11 Hyrox© recreational athletes
(27% female), with around
18 months of experience.
To analyse the acute physiological
responses and determinants of
performance in a simulated Hyrox
competition.
VO2max, body composition and
strength were assessed; they then
performed a full Hyrox simulation
with continuous measurement of
heart rate, lactate and RPE.
The test had a high cardiovascular
demand (80% in the very high HR
zone). VO2max, low fat % and
resistance training volume
correlated with better performance.
Wall balls were the most demanding
exercise. Hyrox is a predominantly
aerobic modality with high
functional demands, which makes it
suitable both for health promotion
and for people who require a high
level of fitness in their work, such
as security, emergency or armed
forces personnel.

HIFT and one HICT.
To compare physiological and
psychobiological responses during
and after a HIFT session with a
HICT session.
Heart rate, blood lactate, anxiety,
perceived exertion and discomfort
were measured. HICT intensity was
adjusted to match the mean HIFT
heart rate.
Maximum heart rate, blood lactate
concentration and perceived
exertion were significantly higher in
HIFT than in HICT (p < 0.05).

anaerobic performance between
sexes in CrossFit athletes,
evaluating absolute and relative
values in different maximal effort
tests.
Cross-sectional study that assessed
body composition and anaerobic
performance using three maximal
exercise tests: Wingate, Repeated
Jumping and Anaerobic Squat Test.
Men showed higher peak and mean
power in all tests, although the
differences decreased when
adjusting for lean and muscle mass.
Mean power remained higher in
men, except in the adjusted squat.
Females showed greater fatigue in
repeated jumps, with no differences
in other tests.

To examine the assessment between
anthropometric measures,
cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular
power, local muscular endurance
and Total Athleticism Score (TSA)
with performance in the CrossFit
Open 2021.
Participants were tested in different
tests separated by weeks, including
fat percentage, maximal oxygen
consumption, muscle power (power
clean) and local muscular
endurance (Tibana Test).
A high correlation (r = 0.91;
p < 0.01) was found between TSA
and CrossFit Open 2021 z-scores,
with the best and worst scores
overlapping in both.
Martinho, Rebelo

68 investigations analysed adults
with CrossFit experience,
considering diverse demographic
characteristics and levels of
competition, providing a
comprehensive view of the physical
demands and physiological
responses in these practitioners.
To synthesise the current evidence
on physical demands and
physiological responses to CrossFit,
identify gaps in the literature and
examine correlations between
different physiological variables
and CrossFit performance.
A review was conducted following
PRISMA 2020, with searches in
PubMed, Scopus and Web of
Science. Studies on physical and
physiological parameters in adult
CrossFit® practitioners were
included, and a meta-correlation
was performed to analyse
predictors of performance.
Studies show that physical and
physiological markers vary
according to the type of CrossFit
training, indicating specific
demands on the body. Between 48
and 72 h are required for full
recovery after intense sessions.
Benefits in muscle hypertrophy and
strength are similar to those of
concurrent training.

The sample consisted of 60 high
performance CrossFit® athletes,
men and women from the top 5% of
the CrossFit Open, including
7 semi-finalists and 3 finalists from
the CrossFit Games.
Establish detailed physiological
profiles of highly trained CrossFit®
athletes and determine which
physiological markers correlate best
with CrossFit Open performance.
Peak leg and trunk strength was
measured with dynamometers,
jump height and traction force with
a force platform. Peak VO2 was
assessed in a cardiopulmonary test
and critical power and W’ in a 3
min cycloergometer test.
Men had a peak VO2 of
4.64 L·min−1 and women
3.21 L·min−1. Critical power was
314.5 W in men and 221.3 W in
women, and traction force was
3158 N in men and 2035 N in
women. Regression showed that
anthropometric variables were
associated with CrossFit
performance, but only in women
was the relationship with peak VO2
significant.
Wang, Soh [20]
13 high quality investigations, with
478 athletes aged 10 to 24.5 years
testing various sport disciplines,
including judo, taekwondo,
wrestling and football.
To assess the impact of HIFT on the
general fitness and sport-specific
performance of athletes.
A systematic review and
meta-analysis was performed
following PRISMA, searching five
databases. The methodological
quality of the studies was assessed
using the PEDro scale. Variables
such as strength, power, speed,
endurance, agility and flexibility
were analysed.
The meta-analysis showed that
HIFT improves strength, power,
speed, endurance and agility, with
significant effects in these areas.
However, it has a minor impact on
flexibility, suggesting that specific
exercises are needed to improve
flexibility.

33 participants (22 men and
11 women) with an average age of
34.9 years, weight of 72.3 kg, height
of 1.72 m and a BMI of 24.4 kg/m2
.
They were experienced in HIFT and
performed 60–90 min sessions.
To assess autonomic responses and
internal load through heart rate
variability (HRV) during a HIFT
session.
Heart rate variability (HRV) was
analysed at three points in time:
specific warm-up, exercise phase
(50 min) and recovery phase
(10 min). A Polar H10 heart rate
monitor and the Elite HRV
application were used, transferring
the data to the Kubios HRV
Standard software version 3.3.1. for
processing.
HIFT can alter HRV, affecting
autonomic behaviour, and that this
type of training can provide
significant levels of load, affecting
physiological responses and,
consequently, the individual’s
functional efficiency.

oxidative capacity and resting
vascular function in adult CrossFit®
exercisers and a sedentary group.
Maximal aerobic capacity (VO2
peak), substrate oxidation during
high-intensity exercise, resting
mitochondrial oxidative capacity
and resting vascular function were
measured. Oxidation was assessed
with indirect calorimetry,
mitochondrial capacity with NIRS,
and vascular function with
flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in
the brachial artery.
Chronic participation in
high-intensity functional training
programmes, such as CrossFit, can
improve aerobic capacity, substrate

27 non-professional CrossFit®
athletes (18 men and 9 women) with
an average age of 30.9 years and
16.1 months of experience, training
approximately 2.9 h per week.
To assess how physiological
parameters measured by HR vary
during four one-hour CrossFit
sessions in non-professional
athletes and what factors influence
these variations.
The one-hour sessions were divided
into warm-up (WU), skill and
strength development (A), and
high-intensity training (B). Heart
rate (HR) was measured during
each part to assess the intensity and
internal load of the training.
HR was significantly higher in part
B of the workout compared to parts
A and WU. The one-hour CrossFit®
sessions combine anaerobic and
aerobic intensities, allowing
beginners and experienced athletes
to train with similar cardiovascular
responses and intensity levels.

immediately after it is performed.
Scoping review according to Arksey
and O’Malley, searching three
databases to identify articles on
HIFT. Variables such as immediate
cardiovascular, metabolic,
hormonal and immunological
responses to training were studied.
HIFT significantly increases heart
rate, blood pressure, lactate and
oxygen consumption, indicating
high cardiovascular and metabolic
demand. It also elevates adrenaline,
cortisol and affects the immune
system, suggesting modulation of
the immune system.
De Brito,

The study included 32 HIFT
practitioners, divided into three
performance groups: Elite
(7 participants, 28.9 years,
50 months of practice, 13.5 h/week),
Advanced (10 participants,
33.4 years, 27.6 months of practice,
8.6 h/week) and Beginner
(15 participants, 30.6 years,
22.9 months of practice,
4.7 h/week).
To analyse the acute effect of a HIFT
session, specifically the WOD
“Fran”, on the cognitive functions
and physiological parameters of the
practitioners, considering their level
of performance.
Physiological parameters such as
heart rate, blood lactate
concentration and systolic and
diastolic blood pressure, as well as
cognitive functions were assessed
using the five-digit test, before and
after the performance of the WOD
“Fran”. The results were compared
between the different performance
levels.
The Elite group completed the
WOD in less time than the
Advanced and Beginner groups. All
groups showed significant
improvements in executive
functions, with differences
according to performance level.
Increases in post-exercise heart rate
and lactate were also recorded,
varying by competitive level.

To investigate the temporal effects
of a functional fitness training
session performed at different
intensities on metabolic, hormonal
and BDNF responses in trained
men.
In a randomised, crossover design,
participants performed three
sessions: maximal intensity training,
self-regulated intensity and
non-exercise control. Serum lactate,
CK, testosterone, cortisol and BDNF
were assessed at five time points:
pre-exercise, post-0 h, 1 h, 2 h and
24 h post-exercise.
CK concentrations increased 24 h
after both workouts, indicating
muscle damage. There was a
decrease in testosterone after the
all-out session, suggesting further
hormonal suppression. Cortisol
increased after both sessions,
reflecting stress. Only the all-out
session significantly elevated BDNF,
suggesting an impact on
neuroplasticity.

To analyse muscle fatigue and
metabolic stress at 15 min of
recovery after two independent
sessions of Functional Fitness
Training (FFT): one session of
strength training (FFTstrength) and
one session of endurance training
(FFTendurance).
Crossover design, participants
performed two training protocols
(FFT Strength and FFTendurance)
with one week of rest in between.
Neuromuscular fatigue, metabolic
stress, mean heart rate and
perceived exertion were measured
at different times after training.
Speed in the Squat Test recovered
after 15 min rest, while in the
Military Press Test it remained 7%
lower in the FFTstrength session.
Both sessions increased blood
lactate to over 12 mmol·L−1

strength (1-RM) were measured
before and after training.
Both experimental groups
significantly reduced body fat after
6 weeks, with the LL group
showing a greater decrease. The ML
group increased LBM after 6 weeks,
and both groups increased LBM at
the end of 12 weeks. Both groups
also increased maximal strength in
several exercises, while the CON
group showed no significant
changes.

The study included 20 young men
(18–38 years), divided into two
groups: Competitive athletes
(CMP), with advanced HIFT
experience, and Beginner athletes
(BGN), with little or no HIFT
experience.
To compare the physiological
profile of competitive and novice
HIFT athletes, assessing differences
in aerobic capacity, strength and
anaerobic power.
Anthropometry (weight, height,
BMI), aerobic capacity (VO2 peak),
lactate threshold, maximal grip
strength, isometric and isokinetic
lower limb strength, and maximal
anaerobic power (RAST) were
assessed.
Competitive athletes (CMP) had
higher VO2 peak, grip strength and
peak power values compared to
beginners (BGN), with significant
differences in all tests (p < 0.001).

The study included 15 male
recreational CrossFit® athletes with
at least three years of experience
and four weekly sessions. Average
characteristics were: age 24.03 years,
weight 78.2 kg, height 1.75 m, BMI
25.82 kg/m2 and body fat
percentage 19.39%.
To analyse the physical and
physiological variables of
recreational CrossFit® athletes
during “FRAN” training and to
determine which of these variables
best predict performance in such
training.
Participants performed maximal
strength (1RM) and repetition
maximal tests on pull-ups and
thrusters, in addition to “FRAN”
training (21-15-9 thrusters and
pull-ups) and a 2K Row test. Blood
lactate, HRmax, average HR and
RPE were measured before and
after each session.
FRAN performance showed a
strong correlation with maximal
repetitions of thrusters and
pull-ups. Maximal strength in
thrusters and time in 2K Row were
also significantly correlated with
“FRAN”. Lactate concentration,
HRmax, HRprom and RPE were
higher in 2K Row and thruster max
repetitions than in “FRAN”.

85 healthy university students were
divided into two groups: 36 in
traditional weight training (TWT)
and 49 in high-intensity functional
training (CF). The average age was
22.6 ± 4.1 years in TWT and
21.8 ± 3.2 years in CF.
To compare the adaptations in
muscular strength, power and
endurance between two types of
university physical activity classes:
TWT and CF.
Measurements were taken before
and after an 8-week programme,
including vertical jump, grip
strength, push-ups, squats, and
body composition analysis (weight
and fat percentage).
Both groups showed significant
improvements in the number of
push-ups and squats performed
(p < 0.001).
No significant changes in body fat
percentage were observed in either
group.

30 participants distributed in
two groups:
CrossFit® practitioners:
15 individuals.
Crosstraining® practitioners:
15 individuals.
To compare the physical capacities
and anthropometric measurements
between CrossFit® and
Crosstraining practitioners.
Vertical and horizontal jump,
pull-ups, box jumps, push-ups and

event.
To examine the relationship
between CrossFit® test performance
and physiological measures such as
aerobic capacity, anaerobic power
and body composition, to assess
their influence on performance in
typical CrossFit® workouts.
VO2max, anaerobic power (Wingate

body composition (DEXA) were
assessed. CrossFit performance
tests included the “Fran”
benchmark, burpees test and an
Olympic lifting WOD, measuring
times, repetitions and total load
lifted.
Negative correlation between
VO2max and time in “Fran”
(r =−0.72), indicating that athletes
with higher aerobic capacity
completed training faster.
Anaerobic power predicted
Olympic lifting performance

Twenty-five previous CrossFit®
studies were analysed, involving
participants ranging from beginners
to elite athletes, with sample sizes
between 10 and 50 people per study.
To analyse how the combination of
strength and endurance exercises in
CrossFit® WODs affects
physiological adaptations and
performance, seeking to identify
optimal strategies to maximise
strength and endurance without
interfering with performance.
Systematic review compiling
studies on CrossFit® and HIFT,
assessing physiological and athletic
performance, focusing on VO2max,
anaerobic power, maximal strength,
muscular endurance and hormonal
markers, to analyse the impact of
concurrent training on adaptation
and recovery.
Concurrent training in CrossFit
improves VO2max without
interfering with strength. Strategies
such as undulating periodisation
and strength sessions before aerobic
work minimise negative effects.
Although it does not generate
hypertrophy like traditional
weightlifting, it improves functional
strength. Physiological and
hormonal stress is high, requiring
proper rest and recovery planning
to avoid affecting recovery and
performance.

CrossFit Open events.
Several physiological and
experiential variables of the athletes
were assessed, including: resting
energy expenditure, hormone

muscle morphology,
cardiorespiratory fitness and
isometric strength.
These variables were measured on
two separate occasions prior to
participation in the 2018 CrossFit
Open.
Body composition, especially body
fat percentage, was the strongest
predictor of performance in almost
all tests analysed. Competition
experience was also a significant
predictor of performance.
Other factors such as vastus
lateralis cross-sectional area,
respiratory compensation threshold
and rate of force development were
also associated with performance,
although to a lesser extent.

The study included 53 CrossFit
participants divided into two
groups according to weekly
training volume: HT (more than
6 h/week) and LT (less than
6 h/week), compared to age- and
BMI-matched control groups.
To investigate how different
amounts of training affect body
composition and performance in
HIFT participants, specifically
CrossFit practitioners.
Body composition (measured by
DXA), physical performance in the
“Fran” WOD, lactate and blood
glucose levels, and weekly training
volume were assessed in CrossFit
participants.
The HT CrossFit group showed
lower adiposity, higher lean mass
and completed the Fran faster than
the LT group. There was a positive
correlation between appendicular
lean mass and Fran performance.
Lactate and glucose levels increased
after training, but returned to
normal after 15 min of recovery.

Review of existing literature on
high-intensity functional training

sample of participants.
To review current studies on HIFT
and assess how this type of training
can be used to improve
sport-specific performance.
The authors analysed previous
studies on HIFT, focusing on fitness
components (aerobic capacity,
anaerobic capacity, endurance,
hypertrophy, strength and power),
session design that integrates
multiple components, and the
benefits of HIFT on sports
performance and its efficiency
versus other training methods.
HIFT improves multiple
components of fitness
simultaneously, benefiting athletic
performance. It is time efficient, as
it develops several physical
capacities in a single session.
However, more controlled research
in athletic populations is needed to
evaluate its specific effectiveness on
sports performance.

To examine the physiological
responses of advanced CrossFit
athletes to consecutive Wingate
tests with short periods of active
recovery and to determine whether
these responses can predict
performance in a HIFT.
Four consecutive Wingate anaerobic
tests (WAnT) and a CrossFit style
workout (AMRAP) were performed.
Variables measured in the WAnT
included VO2, RER, HR, PP, AP, FI
and TW. During the AMRAP, the
total number of repetitions
completed was recorded.
Significant differences in anaerobic
performance were observed
between the WAnT tests, with
higher PP, AP and TW values, and
lower FI in the first test. VO2, RER
and HR increased in all four tests.
The ability to predict repetitions in
AMRAP improved from the first to
the third WAnT test, highlighting
the importance of maintaining
performance and recovering quickly

The synthesis of the results was structured along four main thematic axes:
3.1. Physiological Demands
Nine studies [8,14,15,17,21,22,26–28] analysed physiological responses revealing that
HIFT methods markedly improve VO2max, maximal strength, power and localised mus-
cular endurance. These capabilities are essential to tolerate the cumulative stress of con-
secutive workouts. A combination of high-intensity intermittent efforts with sustained
loads, which require high energy efficiency and recovery capacity, was observed. Along
these lines, a study simulating a full HYROX competition showed a high cardiovascular
demand, with approximately 80% of the time in very high heart rate zones (41.6% in Zone
4 [80–90% HRmax] and 50.5% in Zone 5 [90–100% HRmax]), as well as significant levels of
lactate and perceived exertion, especially in the final stations [8]. Studies such as Brandt
et al. and Wang et al. [8,14], using meta-analysis, confirmed substantial improvements
in VO2max, maximum strength, and lactate tolerance. D’Hulst et al. [19] documented
advanced physiological profiles in elite athletes with VO2 values of up to 4.64 L/min
in men.
3.2. Predictors of Performance
Eight studies [8,16–19,24,35,40] identified key variables associated with hybrid compe-
tition performance. Key predictors included lean mass, lower body strength, VO2 peak,
functional sports experience and optimised body composition. Research in elite CrossFit
athletes showed that the ability to generate power and sustain it under fatigue is critical in
fast transitional formats [19]. Complementarily, it has been verified that higher VO2max,
lower body fat percentage and high volume of resistance training correlated with better
performance [8,40], underlining the importance of aerobic fitness and structural efficiency
in this type of disciplines.
Zeitz, Cook [40] found a negative correlation between VO2max and completion time
in the WOD “Fran” (r =−0.72). Similarly, Ponce-García, García-Romero [16] and Mangine,
Tankersley [41] that lean mass and competitive experience are robust predictors of perfor-
mance in high-intensity tests.
3.3. Adaptations to Training
Six articles [14,20,31,36,45,47] addressed the adaptations induced by HIFT pro-
grammes. Significant improvements in aerobic and anaerobic capacity, neuromuscular
parameters and metabolic efficiency were documented. In addition, it was shown that
high-intensity sessions generate a physiological environment that stimulates hormonal,
autonomic and immunological responses relevant to the improvement of functional perfor-
mance [21,26–28]. Crawford, Drake [47] and Luis Mate-Munoz, Budurin [31] demonstrated
increases in strength, anaerobic power, and metabolic efficiency after 6-week interven-
tions. Hollerbach, Cosgrove [36] showed significant improvements in muscle strength and
endurance after university HIFT programmes.
3.4. Psychobiological Responses
Four studies [15,27,29,30] examined perception of exertion, subjective fatigue and
recovery. Prior functional training experience was associated with better fatigue tolerance,
greater cognitive efficiency during exertion and less performance decline in prolonged
testing. These psychobiological variables are particularly relevant in hybrid competitions,
where mental resilience may determine performance consistency.
Santos, Morais [15] observed a greater perception of effort and lactate concentration
in HIFT sessions compared to HICT. De Brito, Fernandes [27] found that more experi-
J. Funct. Morphol. Kinesiol. 2025, 10, 365 19 of 24
enced athletes showed less cognitive fatigue and more efficient execution times during the
“Fran” WOD.
In addition to the thematic categorisation, several studies reported concrete quanti-
tative data on physiological improvements. For instance, studies such as Wang, Soh [14]
and D’Hulst, Hodzic [19] reported increases in VO2max of between 8 and 15% following
HIFT programmes. In terms of maximum strength, improvements of 10 to 20% in 1RM
were documented in exercises such as squats or thrusters (Kapsis, Tsoukos [32], Leitao,
Dias [35]). Likewise, localised muscle endurance increased by 12 to 25% in functional exer-
cises and maximum repetition tests (Hollerbach, Cosgrove [36], Adami, Rocchi [33]). These
improvements are relevant for withstanding the cumulative load of hybrid competitions,
where the ability to maintain performance under fatigue is critical.
Although not all studies differentiated by sex, Ponce-García, García-Romero [16]
reported that men have higher absolute values of anaerobic power, although the differ-
ences are reduced when adjusted for muscle mass. In terms of experience level, Adami,
Rocchi [33] and De Brito, Fernandes [27] showed that advanced athletes have higher
VO2max levels, maximum strength, and better fatigue tolerance. In terms of modality, only
Brandt, Ebel [8] specifically analysed the HYROX format, showing a majority cardiovas-
cular load (80% of the time in Z4 and Z5), while most studies focused on CrossFit-type
protocols. Therefore, the lack of comparative data prevented a more in-depth analysis
between disciplines.
Based on a simplified assessment of methodological quality based on design, assess-
ment tools used, and internal validity criteria, the 39 studies included in this review were
classified as follows: 12 studies were considered high quality (systematic reviews, meta-
analyses, or robust experimental designs), 17 were of moderate quality (well-structured
observational studies), and 10 were of low methodological quality (narrative reviews, small
samples, or no statistical control).
In order to facilitate the overall interpretation of the findings, a summary of the
four thematic areas identified is presented below, together with the number of associated
studies, the main results found, representative studies, and the predominant method-
ological quality. This table provides an integrated view of the effects of high-intensity
functional training (HIFT) in hybrid competition contexts, as well as the areas with the
greatest scientific rigour and those where evidence gaps persist (Table 2).

4. Discussion
The main finding of this scoping review is that high-intensity functional training (HIFT)
consistently enhances key physical attributes such as strength, power, and aerobic capacity
in trained populations [14,17]. These improvements are attributed to neuromuscular
adaptations, increased metabolic efficiency, and greater training density, all of which are
essential in hybrid competitions where repeated strength-endurance efforts are required.
Moreover, the reviewed evidence highlights the psychophysiological demands of HIFT,
especially in competitive formats like CrossFit and HYROX, where minimal rest intervals
amplify cumulative load and fatigue-related responses [8,15].
Despite the observed consistency in key outcomes, methodological limitations across
the included studies restrict the strength and generalisability of the conclusions. Many
studies employed small sample sizes, e.g., n < 20 [15,17], which increases the risk of
statistical noise and reduces external validity. Additionally, considerable heterogeneity was
observed in terms of training protocols, session structures, and outcome measures (e.g.,
different WODs, durations, or instruments). This variability complicates direct comparison
and limits the precision with which improvements can be attributed to specific HIFT
formats or intensities. While positive trends are clear, caution is needed when extrapolating
results to broader or non-athletic populations.
These findings align with the interference effect model, which posits that simultaneous
demands on strength and endurance systems can hinder maximal adaptation if not properly
sequenced or recovered. The cumulative fatigue and neuromuscular stress described
in several studies [8,27] illustrate the need for structured programming that minimises
concurrent interference. Likewise, the theory of adaptation pathways is supported by
the observation that training outcomes vary depending on intensity, exercise order, and
training history—suggesting that chronic exposure to HIFT may channel adaptations more
efficiently when stimuli are periodised and strategically targeted.
It is important to acknowledge that not all findings were consistent. For instance, while
most studies reported positive correlations between VO2max and performance [40], others
failed to identify any single physiological predictor with strong explanatory power [25].
Similarly, although strength improvements were widely documented, few studies differen-
tiated results by sex or training level [16], limiting generalisation. Additionally, outcomes
related to recovery varied depending on whether passive or active rest was applied, and def-
initions and protocols differed across studies, reducing comparability. These discrepancies
highlight the need for more standardised research designs within the HIFT literature.
Another relevant consideration is the impact of accumulated fatigue on movement
technique, which may increase injury risk if not properly managed [16,35]. Consequently,
structured training planning, appropriate workload distribution, and tailored recovery
strategies are crucial to maximising performance while preserving athlete safety. Evidence
also suggests that athletes with greater experience tolerate fatigue more effectively, main-
taining technique quality under pressure [27,33]. Furthermore, the nature of rest between
efforts influences recovery: passive rest appears to promote physiological restoration, while
active rest maintains cardiovascular load—an important consideration in hybrid formats
where rest intervals are minimal.
The use of physiological and biomechanical monitoring tools (e.g., heart rate vari-
ability, motion analysis) is recommended to adjust training loads and prevent overuse-
related issues.
The predominance of aerobic contribution in HYROX, as evidenced by the high propor-
tion of time spent in upper heart rate zones (~80%) and elevated lactate levels [8], reinforces
the importance of aerobic efficiency and fatigue resistance in this format. However, the
limited number of studies specifically addressing HYROX restricts the ability to draw firm,
J. Funct. Morphol. Kinesiol. 2025, 10, 365 22 of 24
modality-specific conclusions, especially compared to the more extensive body of research
on CrossFit. Differences in repetition volume, rest structure, and exercise specificity likely
modulate both acute responses and chronic adaptations.
Future research should prioritise well-designed longitudinal studies with standard-
ised HIFT protocols to better understand long-term adaptations. Specifically, randomised
controlled trials comparing CrossFit and HYROX formats over 8–12 weeks would allow
clearer insights into modality-specific effects. Key outcomes should include VO2max,
lactate threshold, neuromuscular fatigue, hormonal markers, and perceived recovery. Sam-
ples should be stratified by sex, age, and training level to explore differential adaptations.
Furthermore, studies should incorporate both physiological (e.g., HRV, creatine kinase)
and perceptual (e.g., RPE, PRS) recovery indicators. Finally, field-based research monitor-
ing injury incidence and biomechanical changes during real competitions would support
applied training design and injury prevention strategies in hybrid sport contexts.
5. Conclusions
The systematic review indicates that high-intensity functional training generates
positive adaptations in strength and endurance, but can also induce significant fatigue,
affecting performance and execution technique. In hybrid competitions efficient fatigue
and recovery management are key factors to optimise performance and to minimise the
risk of injury.
Continuous monitoring of physiological and biomechanical parameters will allow
optimisation of training programmes and reduce the risk of excessive fatigue and injury. In
addition, future studies should focus on assessing muscle fatigue along with metabolic and
physiological analyses for a deeper understanding of the impact of high-intensity training
on endurance athletes.
