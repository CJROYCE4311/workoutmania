# Heart Rate Variability (HRV): The Readiness Metric

## Executive Summary
HRV measures the variance in time between heartbeats. Contrary to intuition, **High Variance is GOOD** (it means your nervous system is responsive and balanced). **Low Variance is BAD** (it means your fight-or-flight system is pegged and your heart is beating like a metronome due to stress).

## Key Methodology
1.  **The "Green" Score (High HRV):**
    *   **Meaning:** Parasympathetic dominance (Rest & Digest).
    *   **Action:** Green light for High Intensity. Go for a PR. Do the heavy squat session.
2.  **The "Red" Score (Low HRV):**
    *   **Meaning:** Sympathetic dominance (Fight or Flight). The body is fighting stress (illness, alcohol, overtraining, lack of sleep).
    *   **Action:** Do NOT push intensity.
        *   *Modification:* Keep the volume, cut the intensity (Zone 2 instead of sprints). Or take a nap.
3.  **The Trend Line:**
    *   Don't obsess over one day. Look at the **7-Day Average**.
    *   If the trend is down for 3+ days, you are overreaching. Deload immediately.

## Application to Our Programming
- **Jim's Wearable Strategy:**
    *   If Jim wears a Whoop/Garmin/Oura:
    *   **Rule:** If HRV drops >10% below baseline for 2 consecutive days:
        *   Cancel the heavy lifting session.
        *   Replace with "Flow" (Movement quality, light weights, flush blood).
    *   **Alcohol Factor:** Educate Jim that one night of drinking will crash HRV. Plan the "Rest Day" after the "Party Day."
