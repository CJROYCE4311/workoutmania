## Executive Summary
Odd Object training (Sandbags, Yokes, Logs) is the bridge between "Gym Strength" and "Real World Strength." Unlike a barbell, which is balanced and ergonomic, odd objects shift their center of mass, forcing the athlete to use stabilizers and core tension that standard lifts miss.

## Key Methodology
1.  **The Sandbag (The "Alive" Weight):**
    *   **Effect:** The sand moves. This forces "Micro-adjustments" in the core and grip.
    *   **Application:** Sandbag Cleans, Bear Hug Carries.
    *   **Benefit:** Incredible posterior chain development and "bracing" practice. If you don't brace, the bag folds you.
2.  **The Yoke (CNS Overload):**
    *   **Effect:** Spinal compression with movement.
    *   **Application:** Yoke Walk.
    *   **Benefit:** Primes the CNS. Walking with 500lbs makes a 300lb squat feel light. It builds "Structural Integrity."
3.  **D-Ball / Medicine Ball:**
    *   **Effect:** Explosive power in odd planes.
    *   **Application:** Over-the-shoulder throws.

## Application to Our Programming
- **The "Jim" Factor:**
    *   Jim is strong, but barbells are predictable. We need to "chaos proof" his back and core.
    *   **Weekly Inclusion:**
        *   **Saturday (Team/Fun Day):** Perfect day for Strongman stuff.
        *   *Workout Example:* 4 Rounds: 50ft Yoke Carry (Heavy) + 10 Sandbag over shoulder + 15 Cal Bike.
    *   **Substitution:** If his wrist hurts (barbell issue), swap Barbell Cleans for Sandbag Cleans. Same hinge, less wrist stress.
