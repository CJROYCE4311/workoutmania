# Deload Protocols: Volume vs. Intensity

## Executive Summary
A "Deload" is a planned reduction in training stress to allow the CNS and musculoskeletal system to recover. There are two main ways to do this: **Volume Deload** (Same weight, fewer reps/sets) and **Intensity Deload** (Lighter weight, same reps/sets).

## Key Methodology
1.  **The "Volume Deload" (Preferred for Strength):**
    *   **Protocol:** Keep the weight heavy (e.g., 85-90% 1RM) but cut the sets by 50%.
    *   *Example:* Instead of 5x5 @ 300lbs, do 2x2 @ 300lbs.
    *   **Why:** It keeps the nervous system primed (heavy load) without inducing fatigue (low volume). Great for "peaking" or maintaining feel.
2.  **The "Intensity Deload" (Preferred for Joints/Connective Tissue):**
    *   **Protocol:** Drop the weight to 50-60%, keep the motion.
    *   *Example:* 3x5 @ 150lbs (instead of 300lbs).
    *   **Why:** Gives joints a break from heavy compression. Good for "active recovery" weeks or coming back from minor injury.
3.  **The "Pivot Week" (CrossFit Specific):**
    *   Change the *mode* entirely. No barbells. Use Dumbbells, Sandbags, and Swimming.
    *   **Goal:** Mental reset + new stimulus.

## Application to Our Programming
- **Strategy for Jim:**
    *   **Standard Deload (Every 4th Week):** Volume Deload.
        *   Jim needs to feel the heavy weight so he doesn't feel "rusty" when he comes back.
        *   *Protocol:* Hit a heavy single (RPE 8) on Mon/Fri, but cut all metcon volume by 50%.
    *   **Post-Competition/Test Deload:** Intensity Deload / Pivot.
        *   After a max-out week, his joints need a break. Run an "Unloaded" week (No barbell).
