## Executive Summary
Chris Hinshaw, a former Ironman champion and CrossFit endurance coach (notably for Rich Froning and Mat Fraser), focuses on building a "wide" aerobic base to support high-intensity work. His methodology prioritizes **pacing** and the development of specific energy systems through targeted intervals, rather than just "going long and slow."

## Key Methodology
1.  **The "Slow" to "Fast" Spectrum:**
    *   Hinshaw categorizes training into 5 buckets:
        1.  **Aerobic Threshold:** Steady state, conversational (Zone 2). Fat adaptation.
        2.  **Lactate Threshold:** Higher volume, "comfortably hard." Shorter rest.
        3.  **VO2 Max:** Lower volume, high intensity. Max oxygen uptake.
        4.  **Speed Endurance:** Very high intensity (<60s work), full recovery. Recruitment of fast-twitch fibers under fatigue.
        5.  **Strength Endurance:** High intensity with resistance (e.g., sled push sprints).
2.  **Pacing Strategy (Negative Splits):**
    *   Athletes must learn to control their output. A core drill is running intervals where each rep *must* be faster than the previous one.
    *   *Example:* 4 x 400m. Goal times: 1:30, 1:28, 1:26, 1:24. If you fail to get faster, you started too fast.
3.  **The Assessment (The "Engine Check"):**
    *   Compare **400m Time** (Speed) vs **1 Mile Time** (Endurance).
    *   If the mile time is slow relative to the 400m potential, the athlete lacks aerobic capacity (Endurance bias needed).
    *   If the mile is strong but 400m is weak, they lack speed (Speed bias needed).

## Application to Our Programming
- **Structure for Jim:**
    *   **Assessment:** Have Jim run a max effort 400m and a max effort 1-mile (separate days) to determine his bias.
    *   **Weekly Dose:** 1 dedicated "Track Session" (can be on Erg) + 1 Recovery Zone 2 session.
    *   **Drill:** "Surges." Within a steady piece (e.g., 20 min row), insert 10-second surges at faster pace every 2 minutes to practice changing gears without redlining.
- **Integration:**
    *   Place high-intensity intervals (VO2 Max/Speed Endurance) on days *before* a Rest Day or light active recovery.
    *   Place Zone 2 work as a secondary session (PM) or on active recovery days.
