# Linear vs Undulating Periodization

## Executive Summary
For beginners, **Linear Periodization** is superior because it provides a predictable, progressive overload that matches their rapid rate of adaptation. **Undulating Periodization** (changing volume/intensity daily) is too complex for novices who haven't yet plateaued on linear gains.

## Key Methodology
1.  **Linear Periodization (The "Straight Line"):**
    *   **Concept:** Volume starts high/intensity low. Over weeks, volume drops and intensity rises.
    *   **Structure:** 4 Weeks @ 10 reps -> 4 Weeks @ 8 reps -> 4 Weeks @ 5 reps -> 4 Weeks @ 3 reps.
    *   **Why for Beginners?** It reinforces technique through high reps early on and guarantees "Newbie Gains" by simply adding 5lbs to the bar every week.
2.  **Daily Undulating Periodization (DUP):**
    *   **Concept:** Varying the stimulus *every session*.
    *   **Structure:** Mon (Hypertrophy/10 reps), Wed (Power/3 reps), Fri (Strength/5 reps).
    *   **Why Not for Beginners?** Beginners don't need "novelty" to adapt; they need consistency. DUP can mask progress if form isn't solidified.

## Application to Our Programming
- **Strategy for Jim (Advanced Intermediate):**
    *   Jim is likely *past* the "Linear" phase for raw strength. A 5x5 linear program might stall him quickly.
    *   **However:** For *new* movements (e.g., if we introduce "Sandbag Cleans"), use Linear progression (start light, add weight weekly).
    *   **For Main Lifts:** Stick to the Conjugate (Undulating) model we established, as he needs the variety to avoid burnout.
- **Client Application:**
    *   For any *new* client with < 6 months experience: **Strict Linear Progression**. Do not get fancy. Squat, Press, Deadlift, add weight.
