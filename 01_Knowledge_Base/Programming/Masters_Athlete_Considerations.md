## Executive Summary
Athletes aged 35-50 ("Masters") face physiological changes—specifically slower protein synthesis, reduced hormonal output (Testosterone/GH), and declining VO2 max—that make "standard" volume-heavy programming counterproductive. The goal is to maintain intensity while increasing recovery density.

## Key Methodology
1.  **The Recovery Gap:**
    *   Masters athletes take **48-72 hours** to recover from intense CNS work (heavy lifting), compared to 24-48 for younger athletes.
    *   **Rule of Thumb:** "2 days on, 1 day off" or "3 days on, 1 day active recovery, 1 day off" is often superior to the traditional "3 on, 1 off" or "5 on, 2 off."
2.  **Sarcopenia & Anabolic Resistance:**
    *   Muscle mass naturally declines after 35.
    *   **Counter-measure:** Protein intake must be *higher* (1.6-2.0g/kg) to trigger the same muscle protein synthesis response.
    *   **Strength is Non-Negotiable:** Heavy resistance training is the only thing that stops bone density loss and sarcopenia. You cannot just "do cardio."
3.  **Hormonal Reality:**
    *   Cortisol management is key. Long, grinding metcons (20+ mins) spike cortisol. If recovery is poor, this cortisol stays elevated, eating muscle.
    *   **Focus:** Shorter, higher intensity bursts (HIIT) often preserve muscle better than chronic cardio for this demographic.

## Application to Our Programming
- **Structure for Jim (Age ~53):**
    *   **Frequency:** He cannot handle 5 days of "smashing."
    *   **The "High-Low" Model:**
        *   **High Days (Mon/Fri):** High CNS load (Heavy Squats + Hard Metcon).
        *   **Low Days (Tue/Thu):** Skill work, Zone 2, or Bodybuilding (low CNS stress).
        *   **Wednesday:** Pure Active Recovery (Swim/Hike).
    *   **Deloads:** Mandatory every 4th week. Volume drops by 40-50%.
    *   **Sleep:** If Jim gets < 7 hours sleep, the next day's intensity *must* be scaled down.
