# Block Periodization: The Peaking Protocol

**Tags:** Peaking, Competition, Periodization, Tapering

## Executive Summary
Block Periodization organizes training into distinct phases (Accumulation, Transmutation, Realization) to peak for a specific event. Unlike Linear periodization (which builds general fitness), Block Periodization is about **transferring** that fitness into sport-specific performance at the exact right time.

## Key Methodology
1.  **Accumulation Phase (4-8 Weeks):**
    *   **Goal:** Build the "Engine" and "Armor" (Hypertrophy/Aerobic Base).
    *   **Focus:** High volume, lower intensity, general movements.
    *   **Example:** 4x10 Back Squats, Zone 2 Rowing.
2.  **Transmutation Phase (3-4 Weeks):**
    *   **Goal:** Convert general strength into specific power.
    *   **Focus:** Moderate volume, higher intensity, sport-specific movements.
    *   **Example:** 5x3 Squats @ 80%, "Fran"-style intervals.
3.  **Realization (Peaking) Phase (1-2 Weeks):**
    *   **Goal:** Dissipate fatigue to reveal fitness (Taper).
    *   **Focus:** Low volume (drop by 50%), High Intensity (keep the nervous system sharp), High specificity.
    *   **The Taper Rule:** "Fatigue masks Fitness." You are fit, but you are tired. The taper removes the tired.

## Application to Our Programming
- **Jim's "Game Day" Protocol:**
    *   Jim has no "CrossFit Games," but he might have a local throwdown or a "Test Week."
    *   **The 10-Day Taper:**
        *   **Days 10-7:** Normal Intensity, 75% Volume.
        *   **Days 6-4:** High Intensity (Hit a few heavy singles), 50% Volume.
        *   **Days 3-2:** Active Recovery / Potentiation (Move fast, very light).
        *   **Day 1:** Rest.
        *   **Day 0:** Competition/Test.
