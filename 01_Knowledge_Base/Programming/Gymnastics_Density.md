# Gymnastics Density: Building Volume Without Injury

## Executive Summary
Gymnastics "Density" refers to the ability to do *more work in less time* (reps per minute). For CrossFitters, the goal isn't just a "Max Set" of pull-ups; it's the ability to do 50 pull-ups in 5 minutes while fatigued. The training progression must move from "Strict Strength" -> "Volume Accumulation" -> "Metcon Density."

## Key Methodology
1.  **Phase 1: Master Your Singles (EMOM Style)**
    *   **Goal:** Perfect mechanics under mild fatigue.
    *   **Protocol:** EMOM 10: 1 Rep (Muscle-up, HSW 10ft, etc.).
    *   **Progression:** Shorten the rest. E20s (Every 20 seconds), then E15s.
2.  **Phase 2: "Climb the Ladder" (Volume Building)**
    *   **Goal:** Link reps and handle moderate density.
    *   **Protocol:** "Death By" style or fixed ladders (1, 2, 3... up to failure).
    *   **Focus:** Do not go to failure early. Stop *before* form breaks.
3.  **Phase 3: The "Big Set" Builder (Battery Test)**
    *   **Goal:** Repeatable large sets.
    *   **Protocol:** E2MOM (Every 2 Minutes): 8-10 C2B Pull-ups.
    *   **Why:** Teaches the body to flush lactate and go again.

## Application to Our Programming
- **Jim's Weakness:** Likely "Battery" (doing multiple sets) rather than 1-rep max strength.
- **Weekly Integration:**
    *   **Tuesday (Skill Day):**
        *   *Week 1-3:* EMOM Singles/Doubles (Focus on position).
        *   *Week 4-6:* Density Intervals (e.g., AMRAP 30s work / 30s rest).
    *   **The "30% Rule":** Never program a metcon with gymnastics sets > 30% of his max unbroken set *if* the heart rate is high.
        *   *Example:* If Jim's max pull-ups is 10, do not program sets of 5 in a heavy breathing workout yet. Keep it to 3s.
