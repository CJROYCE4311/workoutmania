READ CHRIS' BIOHow To Build A Powerful Aerobic Engine?
Runners typically lace up the sneakers, go at their own pace outside or on the track and it’s the same straight routine. But this type of monotonous training is doing more harm than good. In a short amount of time your body adapts, the change either stops or goes the opposite direction. We need to focus on maximizing a person’s training to achieve specific goals and combatting any plateauing the body may develop during training. All of the information that’s out there today is geared toward the elite athlete, That’s where the data and the research is going. It’s catering to creating fractional gains. In order to find out your specific limitation, we need to calculate your fatigue factor or the rate at which you slow down from one distance to another distance. Find Your Unique Fatigue Factor A fatigue factor allows you to bridge the gap between your starting pace and where you want to end up as a runner. “You take your 400 meter time and your 1 mile time and look at the relationship between the two,” Hinshaw explains. The key is the amount your speed slows between the two distances. In the elite running community the formula is between 6-8%. In the 20,000+ general fitness enthusiasts I’ve worked with that average is 21-22%.” Train with Precise Personalization Ask yourself, Is this workout in the highest and the best use of my time? Doing an assessment of yourself is important, so you can take into account if it’s speed or endurance that you need to focus. By maximizing your training and then personalizing your routines based on your fatigue factor, you’ll achieve your individual goals. Sounds simple right? While it may be more technical than you ever thought running could be, focusing in on speed or endurance rather than mindless miles has proven to make a difference. Data Driven Programming & Results ‍ “Rich Froning’s time went from 6:00 to 5:41 in 12 weeks just by focusing on his weakness” Hinshaw says of the elite CrossFit athlete’s 19 second improvement on his 1 mile time.”“I’m not focused on coaching the elite specialist looking to win the Olympic Games. I specialize in coaching the fitness enthusiast looking to build confidence while efficiently and effectively maximizing their performance."

Why Aerobic Capacity training System?
Can your programming automatically update the training intensity and pace uniquely based on your progress? This is why Chris teamed up with Metron to offer an affordable and effective solution for his training methodology. With your guidance I was able to take weaknesses and turn them into strengths. It has been great having Hinshaw in my corner giving me direction on endurance training this year. I can't thank him enough. Mathew Fraser 5x Crossfit Games ChampionHe’s the Rich Froning of running. He doesn’t just talk it. He walks it and that’s what I think is important in any sport … it builds some respect that you can’t create. You have to earn it.

Yes and No. This program is designed for CrossFit coaches, trainers, and athletes of all levels. No prior experience with endurance coaching and training is required to participate. However, you do need to be in good health and should always seek clearance with a doctor before starting any exercise activity.
Credit card declined
Declines can happen for a variety of reasons. When a charge is submitted to the customer’s bank, they have automated systems that determine whether or not to accept the charge. These systems take various signals into account, such as your customer’s spending habits, account balance, and card information like the expiration date and CVC.
Since these signals are constantly changing, a previously successful card might be declined in the future. Even if all of the card information is correct, and you previously had a successful payment, a future charge can still be declined by a bank’s overzealous fraud systems.
Credit card error
Most often when we see Credit Card errors it is a result of one of two things.
Our merchant service provider recommends the following:
“If all of the card information seems correct, it is best to have the customer contact his or her bank, inquire for more information, and ask for future charges to be accepted.”

Not at this time. What is unique about the training system is it personalizes your pacing based on your fatigue factor, so we can provide an effective and affordable solution to help you achieve your goal. This system is what he uses to get his athletes ready for the games.

Will Chris share his Games athlete programming methodology?
Chris uses the same assessment and programming method for every athlete he coaches. It should be regarded that while Chris has had enormous success with CrossFit Games athletes, he has had the same success with other athlete types throughout his 30+ years of experience.
Will my workouts be personalized?
All workouts in our system will be personalized based on your latest performance testing data. This is why we built the training system - To bring his meticulously crafted methodology to the masses.
Will your Aerobic Capacity programming reduce my overall strength?
None of the elite or recreational athletes have experienced any reduction in their max lifts. In fact, every athlete has continued to set new personal records. In many cases, those PR's occur on the same day a workout is performed. For example, Rich Froning, after winning the CrossFit Games 4x, set PR's in his vertical jump, back squat, deadlift and clean during his first 16 weeks of programming. Another example, Camille Leblanc-Bazinet started working with Chris in June 2013. Almost one year after winning the 2014 CrossFit Games, Camille performed a 6800m track workout; 3 hours later she hit a personal record in her snatch at 200lbs. Lastly, Mat Fraser ran 3x(3x600m) in 2:15 with 40-second rest between reps and 4 minutes rest between rounds; 3 hours later he hit a personal record with his clean at 375lbs. Three months later, Mat won his first of five CrossFit Games while working with Chris.
