# Movement Interference: Grip, Spine, and Overlap

## Executive Summary
"Interference" occurs when too many movements in a workout (or a week) tax the same muscle group or structural limiter, leading to degradation of form and increased injury risk. The two biggest offenders in CrossFit are **Grip Blowout** and **Spinal Compression**.

## Key Methodology
1.  **Grip Interference:**
    *   **The Problem:** Programming Deadlifts + Toes-to-Bar + Farmers Carries in one session.
    *   **The Result:** The forearm fails before the metabolic system or the prime movers (glutes/abs). The workout becomes a "forearm test" rather than a fitness test.
    *   **The Fix:** Pair "Grip Heavy" movements with "Grip Neutral" movements.
        *   *Bad:* Fran (Thruster/Pull-up) is okay because Thruster is "Push".
        *   *Bad:* Deadlift + Toes-to-Bar.
        *   *Good:* Deadlift + Push-ups + Run.
2.  **Spinal Loading (Axial Loading):**
    *   **The Problem:** Heavy Back Squats (Mon) -> Heavy Deadlifts (Tue) -> Heavy Overhead Press (Wed).
    *   **The Risk:** The spinal erectors never recover. This leads to "tweak city."
    *   **The Fix:** Follow high-compression days with "De-loaded" spine days.
        *   *Monday:* Heavy Back Squat (High Compression).
        *   *Tuesday:* Dumbbell Bench / Pull-ups / Running (Zero Compression).

## Application to Our Programming
- **Audit for Jim:**
    *   **Check his Grip:** If he fails a metcon because his hands hurt, we failed the programming.
    *   **The "Spine Check":** Count the number of days per week he has a barbell on his back or in his hands > 50% 1RM. Limit this to 3 days max.
    *   **Interference Rule:** If Monday is "Pulling" (Deadlifts/Pull-ups), Tuesday *must* be Pushing or Legs only.
