## Executive Summary
The Conjugate Method (popularized by Louie Simmons of Westside Barbell) is a non-linear periodization model that trains multiple motor qualities (strength, speed, hypertrophy) simultaneously within the same week. For CrossFit, it is adapted to build absolute strength without neglecting conditioning, using "Max Effort" (ME) and "Dynamic Effort" (DE) days.

## Key Methodology
1.  **Max Effort (ME) Method:**
    *   **Goal:** Build absolute strength and inter/intra-muscular coordination.
    *   **Protocol:** Work up to a 1-3 Rep Max (RM) on a specific lift.
    *   **Rotation:** You MUST switch the exercise every week to avoid accommodation (Law of Accommodation) and CNS burnout.
        *   *Example:* Week 1: Low Box Squat; Week 2: Front Squat; Week 3: Deadlift vs Bands.
2.  **Dynamic Effort (DE) Method:**
    *   **Goal:** Build Rate of Force Development (RFD) / Speed.
    *   **Protocol:** Lift sub-maximal weights (50-60% 1RM) with maximal speed.
    *   **Volume:** High sets, low reps (e.g., 10x2 Squat, EMOM style). often used with accommodating resistance (bands/chains).
3.  **Repetition Effort (RE) / Accessory Method:**
    *   **Goal:** Hypertrophy and fixing weak links.
    *   **Protocol:** High reps (8-20+), often to failure.
    *   **Selection:** Target lagging muscle groups identified during ME days (e.g., weak triceps = board presses; weak hamstrings = GHD raises).

## Application to Our Programming
- **Structure for Jim:**
    *   **Monday:** Max Effort Lower (Squat/Deadlift variation) + Metcon (Short/Heavy).
    *   **Tuesday:** Dynamic Effort Upper (Bench/Press speed work) + Gymnastics Skill.
    *   **Wednesday:** Aerobic Capacity (Zone 2).
    *   **Thursday:** Dynamic Effort Lower (Speed Squats/Pulls) + Metcon (Longer).
    *   **Friday:** Max Effort Upper (Press/Weighted Pull-up) + Metcon.
- **Integration:**
    *   Use ME days to test Jim's CNS readiness.
    *   Use DE days to reinforce technique under low load but high velocity (critical for Oly lifting transfer).
    *   **Crucial:** Do not let ME days drain the tank for the "Engine" work.
